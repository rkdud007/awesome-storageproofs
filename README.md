## Codebases

- [herodotus-eth-starknet](https://github.com/HerodotusDev/herodotus-eth-starknet)- Starknet-based State Verifier, Herodotus will allow anyone to trustlessly prove any past or current headers, state, and storage values of L1 contracts to other L2 contracts.
- [oracle-bridge](https://github.com/web3masons/oracle-bridge) - A proof of concept EVM to EVM cross-chain communication protocol using EVM Storage Proofs and Oracles by web3Manson

## Projects

- [Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/) - Scale data-rich applications on Ethereum. Access and process historic on-chain data trustlessly from your smart contract.
- [Herodotus](https://herodotus.dev/) - Storage proof technology that enables cross-domain data access between Ethereum layers
- [Lagrange Labs](https://www.lagrange.dev/)- Seamlessly interact between chains with cryptographically secure state proofs, not opaque intermediaries. Run expressive and dynamic distributed ZK computation at a Big Data scale on top of multi-chain contract states.
- [nil Foundataon](https://nil.foundation/about) =nil; Foundation is a pioneer in zero-knowledge technology, dedicated to making zkProofs and trustless data management accessible for developers.
- [Sunninct Labs](https://www.succinct.xyz/) - Powered by this proof of consensus, light client contracts on the target chain store the block headers of Ethereum. This enables anyone to supply state proofs of Ethereum (balances, storage, transactions, events, etc.)
- ZeroSync

## Usecases

- [StarkBadge](https://twitter.com/piapark_eth/status/1666435331112026112) - Reflect your historical data (storage proof of ownership storage) in Ethereum into a Starknet.
